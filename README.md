## Project Description
This project presents a decision tree classifier implemented from scratch. It evaluates the decision tree on a dataset using metrics such as the confusion matrix and the related accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The tree can be visualized graphically.

## Contents
- "main.py" : The main Python script for implementing decision tree algorithms, evaluations, and visualizations. The code related with buidling the tree classifier, the evaluation and its visualization can be found in the directories named "tree", "evaluation", and "visualisation" respectively.

- "report.pdf" : Detailed report discussing the theoretical background, implementation details, and findings of the project, including visualizations.

## Key Features
- **Decision Tree and Visualisation:** Implementation of decision tree algorithms and their visual representation.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Analysis using cross-validation classification metrics before and after pruning.
- **Pruning Analysis:** Investigation of the impact of pruning on decision trees to mitigate overfitting and improve model performance.
- **Depth Analysis:** Exploration of tree depth as a significant factor affecting model accuracy and generalization capability.

## Libraries
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
